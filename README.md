## Overview

Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is
the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run.

https://www.debian.org/

## Description

Use this script to build your own base system.

We've included the  last ca-certificates files in the repository  to ensure that
all of our images are accurates.

## Tags

- 5, lenny
- 6, squeeze
- 7, wheezy, oldstable
- 8, jessie, stable, latest
- 9, stretch, testing
- sid

## Requirements

On Debian you need sudo permissions and the following packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install debootstrap
```

On Ubuntu you need sudo permissions and the following packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring debootstrap
```

You also need to be in the docker group to use Docker.

```bash
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker USERNAME
```

Finally you need to login on Docker Hub.

```bash
$ docker login
```

## Usage

You first need to choose which dist  between squeeze, wheezy and jessie you want
(jessie  will  be  the  latest  tag)  and  you  need  to  choose  you  user  (or
organization) name on Docker Hub.

Show help.

```bash
$ ./build.sh -h
```

Build you Debian image (eg. wheezy).

```bash
$ ./build.sh -d wheezy -u rockyluke
```

Build you Debian image (eg. jessie) and push it on the Docker Hub.

```bash
$ ./build.sh -d jessie -u rockyluke -p
```
